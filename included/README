This directory contains an early trunk release of Changhyun Choi's OrganizedEdgeDetection class, which is part of the Point Cloud Library's features subsystem.  I found it necessary to modify his code as described in the included patch files in order to expose more configurability for the high curvature edge detection routine.  In order to build my code, it will be necessary to compile the latest release of PCL, backport in the OrganizedEdgeDetection class and its dependency, the 2d subsystem, and patch the class using these files.  The first two steps are covered in the report accompanying this code, while the latter is accomplished by running the command: $ patch <original file> <patch file> .  In case the patches fail on the latest trunk version of Choi's class, you may either manually fix the problem (probably the better solution) or apply them instead to the snapshot version included in this directory (the lazy way out).  Best of luck!  --Sol
