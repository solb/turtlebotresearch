The code relies on Changhyun Choi's OrganizedEdgeDetection class; at the time of writing, this is only available in the trunk version of the Point Cloud Library, which doesn't even come close to compiling.  The appendix of my accompanying report has some preliminary information about how to compile the current latest release-quality build of the library, PCL 1.6.0.  It also includes a general guide to backporting Choi's class into this release, but makes reference to patches needing to be applied in order to get things to compile.  Well, here they are; when you get to the step that alludes to them, substitute the following steps:
$ patch common/include/pcl/impl/point_types.hpp <path to the included point_types.hpp.patch>
$ patch features/include/pcl/features/organized_edge_detection.h <path to the included organized_edge_detection.h.patch>
