The code relies on Changhyun Choi's OrganizedEdgeDetection class; at the time of writing, this is only available in the trunk version of the Point Cloud Library, which doesn't even come close to compiling.  The appendix of my accompanying report has some preliminary information about how to compile the current latest release-quality build of the library, PCL 1.6.0.  It also includes a general guide to backporting Choi's class into this release, but makes reference to patches needing to be applied in order to get things to compile.  Well, here they are; when you get to the step that alludes to them, substitute the following steps:
$ patch features/include/pcl/features/organized_edge_detection.h <path to the included organized_edge_detection.h.patch>
$ patch features/include/pcl/features/impl/organized_edge_detection.hpp <path to the included organized_edge_detection.hpp.patch>
REMINDER: Neither of these patches will work on any version of the OrganizedEdgeDetection class except r6467, so plan to either use that revision or use one of [r6334,r6467) and make slight modifications to both patches.
